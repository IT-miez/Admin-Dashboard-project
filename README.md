# The Odin Project -  Admin Dashboard page
This project was made while doing The Odin Project. </br>
The page is a simple admin dashboard site made by structuring it with **grid** and **flexbox** together</br><br>

## Live site
GitHub Pages site: https://it-miez.github.io/Admin-Dashboard-project/
</br></br>

## Technologies used
**HTML** (basic elements) </br>
**CSS** (styling using **grid** and **flexbox**, colors, borders, gaps, hover-effects, responsive design)</br>
</br></br>

## What I learned
I learned to use grid and combine flex and grid together. I used grid when I wanted to make a layout for my site, then I used flex inside the grid ares to easily center and output the content.

## NOTE
STILL UNDER PRODUCTION!
